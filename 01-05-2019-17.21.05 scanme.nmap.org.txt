A specially crafted packet can be sent to the victims computer and can lead to a heap based buffer overflow resulting in remote code execution. This client is always listening, has root privileges, and requires no user interaction to exploit.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Tested Versions\\r\\nPharos PopUp Printer Client 9.0\\r\\n\\r\\n### Product URLs\\r\\nhttps://pharos.com/products-services/\\r\\n\\r\\n### CVSSv3 Score\\r\\n10.0 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H\\r\\n\\r\\n### CWE\\r\\nCWE-122 - Heap-based Buffer Overflow\\r\\n\\r\\n### Details\\r\\nPharos PopUp Printer client is printing software that is widely used in universities all over the United States. This client is a way to manage multiple connections to a single printing point and is constantly listening in the background for a packet from the printer. It is also running with root privilege for easy access to any privileged drivers. These all make this an excellent target where a vulnerability could have a high impact.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vulnerability is located inside of the DecodeString function. The packet strings are sent to the program encoded in an encoding format. This function parses the packet and decodes the string. First off the function locates the end of the string, reads in some data from the packet and finally passes it into a decode function. This code is shown below.\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n__text:0000000100005E21                 mov     rsi, [rbx+PSComDecodePacket.end_of_str]     [1]\\r\\n__text:0000000100005E28                 movzx   ecx, byte ptr [rsi]\\r\\n__text:0000000100005E2B                 mov     eax, ecx\\r\\n__text:0000000100005E2D                 and     eax, 3Fh\\r\\n__text:0000000100005E30                 cmp     eax, 10\\r\\n__text:0000000100005E33                 jnz     short loc_100005E98\\r\\n__text:0000000100005E35                 lea     rax, [rsi+1]\\r\\n__text:0000000100005E39                 mov     [rbx+PSComDecodePacket.end_of_str], rax\\r\\n__text:0000000100005E40                 mov     al, 1\\r\\n__text:0000000100005E42                 test    cl, cl\\r\\n__text:0000000100005E44                 js      short loc_100005E74\\r\\n__text:0000000100005E46                 mov     edx, [rsi+1]                                [2]\\r\\n__text:0000000100005E49                 add     rsi, 5\\r\\n__text:0000000100005E4D                 mov     [rbx+PSComDecodePacket.end_of_str], rsi\\r\\n__text:0000000100005E54                 mov     [r14], rsi\\r\\n__text:0000000100005E57                 add     [rbx+PSComDecodePacket.end_of_str], rdx ;\\r\\n__text:0000000100005E5E                 test    cl, 40h\\r\\n__text:0000000100005E61                 jz      short loc_100005E72\\r\\n__text:0000000100005E63                 add     rbx, 20h\\r\\n__text:0000000100005E67                 mov     rsi, [r14]\\r\\n__text:0000000100005E6A                 mov     rdi, rbx\\r\\n__text:0000000100005E6D                 call    xor_decode                                  [3]\\r\\n```\\r\\nAt the beginning, EDX is being checked against zero, [1], then we subsequently fall into a loop. Some data is then grabbed from the packet structure and used at location [2]. This is XORd against user data in an attempt to deobfuscate the packet received. Continuing down a touch further we see an increment to RSI, CL and a decrement to EDX. EDX is then tested against zero and it is clear the loop will continue until EDX reaches zero. This means that the loop will be executed however many times the attacker passed in from the previous function, directly taken from the packet. The code will continue incrementing the packet pointer in RSI, causing a buffer overflow of attacker controlled data and ultimately leading to remote code execution.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Crash Information\\r\\n```\\r\\n./exc_handler ./psnotifyd\\r\\n2017-01-24 13:18:26.374 psnotifyd[24597:8732293] Notify listening thread started\\r\\n2017-01-24 13:18:26.375 psnotifyd[24597:8732293] Listening on socket 4\\r\\n2017-01-24 13:18:26.377 psnotifyd[24597:8732289] CFSocketSetAddress bind failure48\\r\\n2017-01-24 13:18:26.377 psnotifyd[24597:8732289] Telling any existing Notify processes that psnotifyd has started up.\\r\\n2017-01-24 13:18:36.153 psnotifyd[24597:8732293] New notify connection incoming\\r\\n2017-01-24 13:18:36.153 psnotifyd[24597:8732293] Spawning a new notify request handler thread\\r\\n2017-01-24 13:18:36.153 psnotifyd[24597:8732293] Listening on socket 4\\r\\n2017-01-24 13:18:36.153 psnotifyd[24597:8732519] New request handler thread started\\r\\n2017-01-24 13:18:36.153 psnotifyd[24597:8732519] I got some stuff goin on\\r\\n2017-01-24 13:18:36.157 psnotifyd[24597:8732293] New notify connection incoming\\r\\n2017-01-24 13:18:36.157 psnotifyd[24597:8732293] Spawning a new notify request handler thread\\r\\n2017-01-24 13:18:36.157 psnotifyd[24597:8732293] Listening on socket 4\\r\\n2017-01-24 13:18:36.157 psnotifyd[24597:8732522] New request handler thread started\\r\\n2017-01-24 13:18:36.157 psnotifyd[24597:8732522] I got some stuff goin on\\r\\n2017-01-24 13:18:36.218 psnotifyd[24597:8732519] Exception*** -[_NSZeroData getBytes:range:]range {5, 4} exceeds data length 0\\r\\n\\r\\nCrashed thread log =\\r\\n\\r\\n0   psnotifyd                       0x0000000100006d19 0x100000000 + 27929\\r\\n1   psnotifyd                       0x0000000100005e72 0x100000000 + 24178\\r\\n2   psnotifyd                       0x0000000100005c81 0x100000000 + 23681\\r\\n3   psnotifyd                       0x0000000100002071 0x100000000 + 8305\\r\\n4   psnotifyd                       0x0000000100002937 0x100000000 + 10551\\r\\n5   psnotifyd                       0x0000000100002392 0x100000000 + 9106\\r\\n6   com.apple.Foundation            0x00007fff89e3de64 __NSThread__start__ + 1351\\r\\n7   libsystem_pthread.dylib         0x00007fff997ec99d _pthread_body + 131\\r\\n8   libsystem_pthread.dylib         0x00007fff997ec91a _pthread_start + 168\\r\\n9   libsystem_pthread.dylib         0x00007fff997ea351 thread_start + 13\\r\\n\\r\\nlog name is./crashlogs/overflow.crashlog.txt\\r\\n---\\r\\nexception=EXC_BAD_ACCESS:signal=10:is_exploitable=yes:instruction_disassembly=xorb  %al,(%rsi):instruction_address=0x0000000100006d19:access_type=write:access_address=0x0000000104000000:\\r\\nCrash accessing invalid address.\\r\\n```\\r\\n### Timeline\\r\\n* 2017-02-07 - Vendor Disclosure\\r\\n* 2017-03-07 - Public Release\\r\\n\\r\\n### CREDIT\\r\\n* Discovered by Tyler Bohan of Cisco Talos.

Tested between Server 2016 and Windows 10 Anniversary Edition  \\r\\nClassRemote Code Execution\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Summary:\\r\\nAccessing a compromised WMI server over DCOM using System.Management classes or the Powershell Get-WmiObject Cmdlet can lead to the server running arbitrary code on the calling machine leading to RCE.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Description:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dangers of using .NET for DCOM are well know, the SRD blog made a post (https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/srd/2014/10/14/more-details-about-cve-2014-4073-elevation-of-privilege-vulnerability/) which explicitly said it shouldn’t be used between trust boundaries. Presumably people took this to mean implementing servers, but it’s also a risk if a .NET DCOM client connects to an untrusted endpoint. This is due to the IManagedObject interface which will automatically force a client to deserialize an untrusted BinaryFormatter stream which is known bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne common use of DCOM in the .NET framework is for WMI access. The old classes in the System.Management namespace are still accessible (even though technically supersceded by Cim classes) and in powershell they act as the backend for Get-WmiObject and family. Through inspection it’s clear that a number of places the client querys for IManagedObject (for example on the IWbemServices object returned from IWbemLevel1Login::NTLMLogin method) and would be vulnerable. If this interface is being queried it means that a .NET client is trying to create an RCW and will try and create a local copy of a remote serializable object.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore in corporate scenarios where some central system is using WMI over DCOM for management and analysis of running systems (and the management code is using the old .NET/PS classes to do the calls) a compromised machine which replaces the WMI service with its own malicious one could get arbitrary code execution on the monitoring machine. As this is typically going to be a higher privileged account (due to the requirements of DCOM access) it probably makes it more serious.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking at the network traffic the initial CreateInstance call on the remote activator is only using CONNECT level authentication. This means that it might also be possible to MITM (or Man-At-The-Side)  a .NET WMI client and send it back a malicious COM objref to get it to communicate with the attackers server. \\r\\n\\r\\nOf course ideally no one would do this, or use the old style .NET and PS commands. But I’m sure there are networks out there which do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nProof of Concept:\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve provided a PoC as a C# project. You’ll need to also set up some machines to test this out. I’ve tested it in a simple environment of a Server 2016 server acting as a DC and a Windows 10 client. The serialized stream is tailored specifically for 4.6, I don’t know if it works anywhere else.\\r\\n\\r\\n1) Compile the C# project and copy the binary to c:\\\\service\\\\FakeWmiServer.exe on the Client machine.\\r\\n2) Run the following commands in admin Powershell on the client machine to configure the WMI service and add the server executable to the firewall.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName FAKEWMI -Enabled True -Profile Any -Direction Inbound -Program C:\\\\service\\\\FakeWMIService.exe -Protocol Tcp -LocalPort Any -RemotePort Any -LocalAddress Any -RemoteAddress Any\\r\\nNew-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName FAKEWMI -Enabled True -Profile Any -Direction Outbound -Program C:\\\\service\\\\FakeWMIService.exe -Protocol Tcp -LocalPort Any -RemotePort Any -LocalAddress Any -RemoteAddress Any\\r\\nsc.exe config winmgmt binPath= c:\\\\service\\\\FakeWMIService.exe type= own\\r\\nRestart-Service winmgmt -Force\\r\\n\\r\\n3) On the server start powershell.\\r\\n4) On the server execute the PS command “Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Process -ComputerName hostname” replacing hostname with the address of the client.\\r\\n\\r\\nExpected Result \\r\\nWMI connection fails.\\r\\n\\r\\nObserved Result \\r\\nA copy of CMD and Notepad is executed on the server in the context of the calling user.", ", https://www.seebug.org/vuldb/ssvid-92967
